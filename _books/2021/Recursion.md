After reading Blake Crouch's Dark Matter, I decided to follow it up with this book. The style of plot is pretty similar between this book and Dark Matter. I still enjoyed the sci-fi concepts in this book, since it felt like a refreshing new take on the genre (at least in my limited experience). I don't want to say too much since it might spoil it, but this book was a good read, similar to Blake Crouch's Dark Matter. I think the character development was weaker in comparison to Dark Matter, but it was explained in a way where it was reasonable to skip the "development". Similar to Dark Matter, Crouch's distinct writing style, along with the intensive plot, makes it incredibly easy to finish the entire book in one sitting.
