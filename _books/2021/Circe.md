This book is about Circe, the daughter of the Titan Helios. This book reimagines the Circe from The Odyssey, and portrays her as relatable. Circe lived a lonely life in the beginning of the book, where she encounters several famous mythological figures such as Prometheus, Daedalus, and others. I found the earlier part of the book slow, but it helped define her character as she got into witchcraft. After she was banished to the island of Aiaia, the story quickly speeds up. I really liked how Circe had to put lots of hard work to master her craft rather than being born great like her siblings.

How the author wrote Circe's inner thoughts was great, especially when she was in dialogue with other characters. She always reflected on the relationships between gods, her thoughts on how people behave, and more. It helped ground Circe to humanity rather than divinity, even when she had to present herself more formally.
