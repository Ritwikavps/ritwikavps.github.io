This book really highlights Ishiguro's stream-of-conscious writing style and use of unreliable narration that was also in Klara and the Sun. This book follows the experiences of Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy who grew up in this boarding school called Hailsham. We are told early on that the students at this school are meant to be carers, but for who and why largely unknown for most of the book. This style of narration slowly exposes us to the slightly dystpoian nature of the world. 

Without spoiling anything, I would describe Klara and the Sun to be the spiritual successor to this book, since it focuses largely on the same themes such as the pursuit of art and the importance of childhood. I would personally recommend this book, but I can see others not liking Ishiguro's writing since largely nothing happens plot-wise. Ishiguro focuses mostly on the development of the characters, and uses realizations in world building to test the characters.
