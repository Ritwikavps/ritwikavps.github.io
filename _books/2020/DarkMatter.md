I hadn't read for almost half a year until I started reading this book. It's almost impossible to put this book down once you start, and I finished it in two sittings. Blake Crouch writes in a simple way with single-line paragraphs and sentence fragments to focus on the fast-paced nature of the book. The story follows Jason Dessen, a small-time college physics professor who one day gets abducted. I think this is the kind of book that should be read without knowing anything about it beforehand besides what I have already said.

The stakes are always high, and I was always on the edge of my seat. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to get back into reading since it's easy to get hooked.
